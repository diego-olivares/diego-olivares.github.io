I am a rising undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My studies here at tech have focused on info internetworks and media; that is, the intersection between data enterprise and computing as an interactive outlet. My objective is to create software that engages the user and connects people together. While studying, I've realized this during my study through multiple outlets: excelling on course projects involving high performance database systems and network communication models, interning in a vertically integrated project to archive a database of artifacts in hip-hop culture through an interactive VR museum, and my personal passion projects in developing online games.
