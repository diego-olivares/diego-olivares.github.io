JINKAI rites! is my current side project, a playground to test a network protocol, RPC, that I was inexperienced with and curious about. Furthermore, the project is a playground for me to practice UI/UX, game feel, and graphics programming. The game is built in Godot using GDscript and GLSL. It is still a WIP.
