This is my current passion project. The primary point of interest here is the rollback netcode solution I custom made for Netcode Visualizer, a semester project for my Enterprise Computing course. Rollback netcode is an upcoming technology that hides appearant input latency in fast paced multiplayer games. It is risen in popularity due to the largest fighting game properties like Street Fighter and Tekken implementing it in their newest release. In this project I have taken my previous implementation and improved upon it, custom tailoring it to fit the needs of a 2D fighting game. The game features a fast paced 1v1 gameplay and responsive UI/UX. The game features online play with lobbies and features common in fighting games such as a trials mode, local versus, and training mode with debug features. The game is built in Godot using C#, GDscript, and GLSL.
