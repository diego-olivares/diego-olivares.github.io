Netcode Visualizer is a semester long project for my Enterprise Computing course. In this class we learned to identify trends in the technology and computer science space and were tasked with creating an app or software by indentifying a trend in the market. I decided to research and create an app that showcases the different types of netcode solutions found in peer-to-peer games to heuristically demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each. These are lockstep, delay-based, and rollback. I intended for the users of my program to come to their own conclusions about the best algorithm to play under which was emphatically rollback netcode. It is an up-and-coming system of algorithms  that predict and synchronize packets sent between two users to reduce input delay. I am a huge proponent of rollback netcode and its standardization in peer-to-peer multiplayer games, so this project was an exciting one for me. The game is built in Godot using C# and GDscript.
